# TerminalVideoPlayer

Play videos directly in your Terminal - using ASCII art! Written in PHP.

We support Black & White and Color, but for some reason Black & White is higher-resolution.

## Usage

Basics

```
omtvideo input.mp4
```

In color:

```
omtvideo input.mp4 --color
```



## Currently beta and invite only, still needs improvement.

## Demo


Please refer to the GIF file:

GIF not showing up? It's quite a large GIF, and even on fast connections, it will take a white to load.
